## ü§î Basically, what is [6utt3rd09](https://brian-ikiara.github.io/6utt3rd09)?

Inspired by classics like DOOM, it's a ray-casting engine with pseudo-3D graphics. Originally C++ and SDL2, now PyGame for ease. Unleash creativity! Craft levels, textures, sprites, and music for a personalized gaming experience. Enjoy retro-style gameplay with a modern twist. Work in progress, 6utt3rd09 plans to go open-source, with a homegrown emulator! A creative project for old-school 3D game lovers.

## ‚ú® Neat, where can I check it out?
