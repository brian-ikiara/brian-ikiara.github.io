> ***A ship has its wood replaced as the days go by. It sinks during a voyage, and it's recovered and rebuilt using wood from a tree of the same species. Which of the ships is the original? That question has defined my journey - till the present.***

:sparkles: Hello there!
</h2>

I’m an ALX-Holberton School Africa Graduate and Fellow at The ROOM Fellowship, with a B. Sc. in Analytical Chemistry. I have three years of experience working as a Software Developer: from my beginnings in 2016 - when I helped showcase an Edu-Tech solution developed by Samsung, called Digischool, at the Africa Innovation Conference - to 2023 - where I managed to engineer a 3D Ray-casting engine using PyGame, called 6utt3rd09, and an AI-powered task scheduling application known as 7om0mi.

:test_tube: These projects you've worked on are intriguing...
</h2>

6utt3rd09 seeks to bridge the gap in Game Development in Africa, whereas 7om0mi does the same in Applied AI. Another highlight of my budding career is when I became an A2SV Generative AI for Africa Hackathon Quarterfinalist, where my team, PixelInfinite, developed a Job Posting platform that aimed to be the next LinkedIn - still in 2023. I completed my Full Stack Software Engineering course in November 2023, where I specialised in Backend Development and got accepted into the ROOM Fellowship and ALX Applied AI.

:rocket: What I've been doing up to now...
</h2>

Since September 2022, I have worked as a Freelance Software Developer and Technical Writer on Upwork and Fiverr, where I got to hone my skills as a Software Developer. Currently, I'm an ALX Applied AI Fellow - an Apprenticeship at the newly established ALX Africa's AI division.

:peanuts: In a nutshell...

I believe in the Art of Software craftsmanship, and I’d love to continue practising this art for the rest of my life, as it is my quiddity.
