## Architecture

***This Project will be in 2 parts***:

### The HARDware 😜: The εµ Platform

> \**TBD by the end of Specialization*\*

This will be emulating a Game console’s hardware and the following
components make up a simple NES console:

#### CPU(*central processing unit*) 🤖

You should know that this is what makes a rock a Computer. 🤣

#### Memory 🧠

This is the **RAM**(*random access memory*) and you also know what that
is. We’ll be dealing with lots of
[**<u>Assembly</u>**](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/assembly_programming/assembly_introduction.htm)
and allocation of memory, which you should know ranges from the
addresses **0x00000000** to **0x0000ffff**(*for a standard computer, and
not a 🗿*). For the NES, it should span across **2KB** i.e. the
addresses **0x0000** to **0x07ff**.[^1]

#### APU(*audio processing unit*) 🔊

This will handle all our **Sound**. This should span across the
addresses **0x4000** to **0x40**

**17**.

#### PPU(*picture processing unit*) 🖼️

This is what handles all the **graphics** in our game, from **texture**
to **surface** rendering, **sprites** and all that 🍦😜.

***Time for a history lesson***:

> *The NES’s original* [**<u>Ricoh 2A03(NTSC)</u>**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricoh_2A03)
> *CPU didn’t have GPU support, (*it shouldn’t be confused with the
> **[<u>Ricoh 2A07(PAL)</u>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricoh_2A03)**
> version, by the way*), so they had to build a separate system
> entirely. With the new integrations in the **PAL** version, it means
> it will be harder to emulate the nitty-gritties(*especially the **bit
> fields** and the lot*). 😱*

#### Cartridge 🧭

This is what houses our **game ROM**(*read-only memory*). All the
libraries and files needed to run our game will be stored in this
component. *It what you used to blow into, as a kid* e.g.
[<u>Sonic</u>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25R7krgt8nM) and
[<u>Super Mario</u>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qcTwuKozs8).😅

#### CIC(*checking integrated circuit*)

This is the **lockout chip** that was a security feature that checked
the authenticity of a **game ROM** using the “**lock and key**”
principle.[^2] Obviously, we’ll not be emulating this component because:

1.  The **game ROM** we’re building isn’t authentic, inherently, and… 😞

2.  It makes the emulator slow. 😆[^3]

With all that info I believe your brain is melting. Trust me, it’s
simple stuff. 😂

### The SoFtWaRe ❄️: The 6uττεrδ09 Game

> \**TBD by now*\*

So the software defines the game itself. It will be a sh\*\*\*\*y,
**honestly…really bad - like Alpha Prime bad**, knock-off of the
original **Wolfenstein** by [<u>Muse
Software</u>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein#:~:text=1981%E2%80%931992%3A%20Muse%20Software,-The%20series%20presents&text=Castle%20Wolfenstein%20was%20developed%20by,especially%20in%20the%20stealth%20genre.).
The following defines the overall Architecture:

#### Game Loop(GL)

This is the **MAIN** and most **IMPORTANT** component of our game as
it’s where all the **input** will be handled, the **game state** will be
updated and the **graphics** will be rendered.[^4]

#### Rendering

This is where we’ll be handling the graphics using SDL-2. Our
**rendering context** will be defined here, our **textures**, **walls**,
**enemies** and any add-ons to the game will be handled here.

#### Map Generation

This is where the levels will be defined.[^5] This is where all the
**layout** of surfaces and objects in the game shall be defined.

#### Player Controls

Once we have the environment, it’s time to explore it![^6] We’ll define
**[<u>Player1</u>](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ready_player_one)**
and their **mechanics + interaction** in this section**.**

#### Collision Detection

This is where we’ll be implementing a technique known as
**[<u>Raycasting</u>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Charles)** that
will help define the overall **Game environment**.[^7]

#### AI and Enemy Behavior

We’ll implement **AI**(*artificial intelligence*) for enemy characters
and then, define their **behavior**/**mechanics**, such as
**path finding**, **line-of-sight detection**, and **attacking
strategies**.[^8]

#### Weapons and Projectiles

We’ll create a variety of weapons that the player can acquire, each with
different **attributes** such as *damage*, *rate of fire*, and *range*
and then, implement **projectile mechanics** for bullets or other
projectiles fired by the player or enemies.[^9]

#### Audio

We’ll utilize the SDL-2 library to handle **audio playback**. Include
**SFX**(*sound effects*) for player actions, enemy sounds,
**BGM**(*background music*), and other in-game audio.

#### User Interface

We’ll be designing and implementing the **user interface elements**,
including **menus**, **HUD** (*heads-up display*), **scoreboards**, and
other relevant information displayed on the screen.

#### Game Logic and State Management

In this section, we’ll develop the game logic to handle events,
transitions between **game states** (e.g.: *menu*, *gameplay*, *pause*,
*scoring*, *level progression* and *game over conditions*) and implement
**save/load functionality** if desired.

#### Optimization and Performance

We’ll be taking into account the various **performance optimizations**,
such as **ERTs**(*efficient rendering techniques*), **spatial
partitioning** for collision detection, and minimizing
**over/under-calculation**.

#### Testing and Debugging

**TDD**(*test-driven development*) is a key philosophy in
**SDLC**(*Software Development Life Cycle*). The key is to regularly
test and debug our game to ensure it functions as intended. For this
we’ll be implementing **logging** + **debugging tools** to aid in
identifying and fixing issues.[^10]

# Parting Shot[^11]

Emulation can be difficult but as Mario would put it:
